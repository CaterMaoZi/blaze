Handmade game server for Minecraft Java Edition. 

Currently a principal goal of this project is to make it easy to update it to newer versions of the game. Other goals are speed and stability: the server shouldn't have CPU spikes, memory spikes, a very slow and expensive start up, and should contain as little failure cases as possible (i.e. stuff Java can't). Users should be able to determine and control the maximum memory usage easily in advance.

Some side effects of these goals are the following: we don't implement world generation, we don't support world upgrading, and we don't implement entity AI. Maybe it will be possible to write plugins for these kinds of things, if this project ever gets that far.
